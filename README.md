## 🎯 Project Idea

**MoA (Mixture of Agents)** is an application that combines multiple AI models (Proposers & Aggregator) to generate a unified, more accurate response.  
Users can enter any question, receive two answers from different models, and then the **Aggregator agent** merges them into a simplified final answer.

                 ✅ Final Unified Response
```

- 🧩 **Model integration**: leverage the strengths of each model.  
- 📚 **More accurate answers**: reduce bias and mistakes from a single model.  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Accessible to everyone**: outputs are simplified, even for kids.  
- 🚀 **High flexibility**: supports both local (Ollama) and remote (HuggingFace) execution.

## ⚙️ Core Components

- **`main.py`**: Streamlit-powered interactive UI.  
- **`logic.py`**: Logic for generating and aggregating answers.  
- **`utils.py`**: Logging and prompt saving.  
- **`models.py`**: Load models (local & remote).  
- **`docker-compose.yml` + `Dockerfile`**: Run the project in containers.  
- **`.env`**: Environment variables (e.g., HF_TOKEN).  
- **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies (Torch, Transformers, Streamlit).  
- **`FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`**: Roadmap for upcoming features.
